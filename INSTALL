To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If your want to install this module to somewhere rather than the default
position, PREFIX option may be set.

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/your/dir/

After installation, config file will be installed in PREFIX/etc/tux_perl.conf.
It should be modified if you want to enable the scripts of your own.
Please refer to the Tux(3) man page.

Config file of tux should be modified to enable tux_perl. Please verify
/etc/tux.mime.types and be sure following line is included:

   TUX/module                      tux x

Modify /etc/sysconfig/tux to include the following lines:

   TUXMODULES="tux_perl.tux"
   MODULEPATH="<TUX_LIB_DIR>"

Usually, the <TUX_LIB_DIR> will be something like

   /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/Tux

An empty file named tux_perl.tux should be created in your DOCROOT of Tux,
so that Tux can recognize tux_perl module:

   %touch <DOCROOT>/tux_perl.tux

Restart tux daemon with
  
   /etc/init.d/tux restart

Then you can access the sample script by

   http://localhost/tux_perl.tux?Static
   http://localhost/tux_perl.tux?Template
