tux_perl version 0.01
================

tux_perl is a Perl extension for Tux. Tux is a high speed web server from
Redhat. With the non-blocking event loop structure and the zero copying
technique, Tux can provide static content at very fast speed. Tux also
provide an interface to develop user space extensions. tux_perl works as
an user space module of Tux, and interprets Perl scripts to provide
dynamic contents.

Tux is embedded into Linux kernel, so tux_perl only work with Linux. Perl
interpreter is also necessary. GCC compilers is required to build some
C libraries.
